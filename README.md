> Data Science Master's Student @ Tamkang University | Full-Stack Developer Intern @ EY Taiwan

Hi! I'm Tim, a passionate graduate student fascinated by data science and a developer who loves solving real-world problems with code. Currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at Tamkang University while working as a Full-Stack Developer Intern at EY Taiwan, I enjoy navigating between academia and industry.

## 🎯 What I'm Currently Working On

My internship at EY gives me the opportunity to work with enterprise-level software architecture—from frontend user experience to backend system design. Every day, I'm learning how to build more robust solutions that meet business needs. Meanwhile, my research at university keeps me sharp in statistical modeling and data analysis.

**Currently Exploring:**
- Enterprise Software Architecture Design
- Advanced Statistical Modeling & Machine Learning
- Data Visualization Techniques
- AI Agent Development & Applications
- Modern Web Development Frameworks (React, Vue.js, Spring Boot)
- Cloud Services & Deployment Strategies

## 🏆 Proud Achievements

### 🥇 Best Popularity Award - Data Science Stroll Competition 2024
**Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica**  
Successfully transformed complex statistical analyses into accessible visualizations, standing out among numerous competing teams. This experience taught me that exceptional data science requires not only solid technical skills but, more importantly, the ability to communicate profound insights to non-technical audiences in an intuitive and understandable way.

### 🥈 2rd Place - 2025 National Freeway Intelligent Traffic Management Competition
**Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering Bureau**  
Developed an intelligent traffic prediction system by innovatively merging deep learning with physics-based shockwave theory, successfully addressing real-world traffic congestion prediction challenges. This project demonstrated the capability to integrate cross-disciplinary knowledge and transform academic research into practical solutions, earning high recognition from the judging panel.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🔬 Project 1: Online Behavior Research - Exploring the Relationship Between Internet Use and Cyberbullying Across Different Demographics
> **Keywords:** `Data Science` `Statistical Analysis` `Visualization` `Multivariate Analysis`

**Project Overview:**  
This research utilizes data from the Taiwan Communication Survey (2021) to investigate the relationship between internet usage patterns and bullying tendencies across different demographic groups through multivariate analysis. The study covers participants aged 19-61 (N=672) and employs statistical methods including Generalized Association Plots (GAP) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). As digital technology rapidly evolves, cyberbullying has become a critical social issue that demands serious attention.

**Tech Stack:** `Python` · `R` · `GAP` · `PCA` · `FA` · `CCA`

**Key Achievements:**
- **Identified Five Distinct User Clusters:** Generalized Association Plot (GAP) analysis revealed five typical internet user groups. Through binary GAP visualization heatmaps, we can clearly observe the boundary characteristics of these five groups from the diagonal distribution: high similarity (light yellow blocks) within each group, with darker colors between groups indicating clear behavioral differences.

- **Discovered Four Key Behavioral Factors:** The research identified four primary dimensions (Internet Behavior Norm Recognition, Bullying Behavior Expression, Negative Impact Recognition, and Conflict Tolerance) that enrich the theoretical framework of cyberbullying behavior. Notably, Conflict Tolerance—a newly discovered factor—reveals the crucial role of individual traits in online behavior formation, an aspect less explored in previous research.

- **Methodological Innovation:** This study demonstrates significant innovation in research methodology. It's the first to apply Generalized Association Plots (GAP) to online behavior research, showcasing this method's unique advantages in handling high-dimensional social behavior data. The research design integrates five multivariate analysis methods, forming a complete analytical chain from exploration to prediction, providing an important reference paradigm for future related studies.

### � Project 2: AI-Powered Traffic Prediction System - Deep Learning Fusion with Physics-Based Shockwave Theory
> **Keywords:** `Deep Learning` `GNN` `Traffic Flow Theory` `Real-time Prediction` `Physics-informed AI`

**Project Overview:**  
This system employs a dual-engine parallel architecture design. The deep learning prediction engine, based on Multi-Task Spatio-Temporal Network (MT-STNet), handles long-term traffic flow trend forecasting. The physics-based shockwave detection engine, grounded in LWR traffic flow theory, specializes in real-time detection and propagation prediction of sudden traffic incidents. By calculating shockwave propagation velocity through Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, it achieves precise prediction of congestion arrival times.

**Tech Stack:** `Deep Learning` · `GNN` · `Vue.js` · `Ollama` · `Traffic Flow Theory` · `TypeScript` · `MT-STNet`

**Key Achievements:**
- **Cross-disciplinary Innovation:** Successfully merged deep learning with physics-based shockwave theory to achieve accurate traffic congestion prediction and real-time warning capabilities. In theoretical innovation, systematically applied seismological shockwave propagation theory to traffic flow analysis, establishing a shockwave calculation model that opened a new theoretical perspective for the traffic prediction field.

- **Technical Breakthroughs:** The MT-STNet model integrates spatio-temporal attention mechanisms with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), incorporating the actual physical topology of highway networks. The generative inference system effectively prevents error accumulation, while the dual-engine parallel architecture dynamically selects the optimal prediction strategy based on traffic conditions.

- **Practical Applications:** The system features differentiated design providing specialized services for both drivers and traffic managers. Introduced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for click-based AI decision support, successfully transforming academic research into a practical web application.
